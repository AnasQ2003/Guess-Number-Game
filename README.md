✅ Objective:
To understand how Python handles decision-making and repetition. This week was about teaching the computer how to “think” and “repeat” actions based on given conditions.

🔍 Activities Performed:
Studied and practiced conditional statements such as if, else, and elif.

Built simple decision-based programs that responded differently based on input.

Practiced loops (both for and while) for repeated execution of code blocks.

Learned how counters and loop boundaries work.

🖥️ Output Observation:
Programs executed multiple branches depending on input. Iterative outputs confirmed the successful working of loops. Loop termination conditions were validated, showing precise control over the flow.

💡 Key Concepts Learned:
Logic structuring using conditions is essential for responsive programs.

Loops are powerful tools that reduce redundancy and automate repetitive tasks.

Proper indentation is not just a style rule in Python, but a functional necessity.

🧠 Reflections:
This week introduced the “thinking” aspect of programming. Writing logic for different scenarios enhanced critical thinking. There was also an appreciation for how many common software functionalities (like validations or calculations) rely on these structures.
